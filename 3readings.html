			<h1> Srnicek Reading </h1>
			<p> Mobile devices have allowed humans to increasingly merge the digital and physical world. From digital maps that track our location to filters that change the color and add detail to our reality via the phone camera, to simple internet access to a vast library of knowledge. In a way, the phones become an extension of our body that allows our mind’s perception to be extended beyond human bodily capacity. A mobile phone is unlike other technologies in that it is a platform with a variety of emerging functions that maintains a certain ideology. Such is determined and restricted by the distributor. Within such a platform many single-use applications can be found. According to Metzinger, humans instinctively see an object’s utility to identify it, as a sort of tool. With digital technology however, one would wonder if this curiosity is lost at all. When looking at a physical object in the material world, the utility of it is bound by the rules of the material world, such as gravity and matter interaction. However, when it comes to digital technology, such rules may not be as clear. One may not be able to instinctively draw a conclusion for the object’s functionality unless it is written in a set of directions by the creator. One would wonder if this encourages our want to see an object’s functionality or if it hinders it since the control may be placed in the creator and not in the user. Another aspect of apps brought up in the article is that of the “Body without Organs” in which a digital application can replace human functions. The author highlights that this phenomenon is not meant to replace the human soul within, but rather be allowed to happen to an extent that it allows experimentation with the loss of individuation. Individuation in this case is described as an oppressing force that provides mostly constraints. While I am not in the camp of belief that every emerging technology will corrupt our humanity, it is interesting to think of how far our dependence on technological extensions could make us rely less on activities that are considered solely human. I for one believe that we will always hold a need for “human” sensations that don’t entirely rely on digital extensions, and that progressing technologies will provide diversions that make us question some of these needs and allow us to decide which aspects are efficient for our daily life and which ones don’t hold up as well. If the loss of individuation is taken to the extreme that the author warns about it would mean that humans could no longer differentiate themselves from the digital platforms and among each other. Loss of individuality in that sense is terrifying, and it may be deemed counterproductive for artists, who often rely on personalities and human interactions to produce quality work. </p>
			<h2> Example App: Whisper App (or other anonymous hsaring apps) </h2>
			<p> Though the app has a fair share of controversies it seems to be the most popular. What I see this app as is an extension toour collective consciousness in a way. It can mimic the idea of the Body without Organs once the human body becomes nothing but just the mind. </p>

			<h1> Pold and Andersen Reading </h1>
			<p> Android and iPhones have become dominant platforms for mobile devices in our everyday life with Google and other phones attempting to reach a sizable audience here and internationally. As a result, the content released in these platforms is subject to moderation by the companies that distribute it. For the most part, it feels like these companies are fine with applications that offer a sort of utilitarian purpose but can have questionable ethics regarding more artistic pieces. Art can carry a bias and is therefore subject to the judgement of the company before it can be carried to its customers. Other methods exist to place questionable applications on mobile devices, such as via jailbreaking. However, the process of jailbreaking requires some knowledge of the inner workings of a mobile device that not every user is aware of. Therefore, to reach a wide audience, creating content that appeases the distributor is the only manner in which an application can be released. Understandably, these companies are private and can enforce such rules to manage the content they are responsible for distributing. The problem surfaces, as mentioned in the article when the regulation of content leads to censorship in the company’s favor that may reveal flaws and controversies about the distributor. Furthermore, the tightness of the software released via the different app stores restricts attempts to remix or hack the content of the software which in the digital age can be detrimental to creativity. Understandably, creators want to hold the rights to their creation, but often open-source online projects can lead to user-based modifications that can vastly improve a certain program or service in a way that may not have been originally intended. Currently, the google and app store are not too artist-friendly since the critique is directly in control by the distributor, and the software cannot be shared and remixed easily. However, both platforms still provide distribution to a wide net of users that can benefit an artist with little means of physical distribution and can also offer new methods for the user to interact with the artist’s programming. </p>
			<h2> Example App: Super Monster Bros by Adventure Time Pocket Free Games </h2>
			<p> Sometimes having the regulation that Apple and Amazon can have on their platforms can help to ensure that lesser quality content is kept out of the store. This app was created solely to scam people witht he use of stolen resources, and Apple has banned it and other renditions multiple times. </p>
