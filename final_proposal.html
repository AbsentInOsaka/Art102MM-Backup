			<h1>The Hive-Mine</h1>
			<p>&nbsp; This app will allow people to record their thoughts in a certain location and upload it to the "Hive-Mine."
			Once inside, the voice reording will be accessible to anyone around the same location, and can add their own thoughts to the Hive.
			At launch, the app will have a few locations available for recording and a map of IV (shown below) that's viewable on your phone showing these locations. 
			In the future, a user will be able to upload a thought to any location, and have any person using the app come across it.</p>
